## Disclaimer
This document shows how to clone an existing master branch into a gh-pages branch in a separate directory.

## Background

## Implementation
This is just a few commands out of a bash history that should show how to do this.

```
# change into the directory where you want to have your gh-pages branch
cd <gh-pages_dir>
# get a clone of the material in the master branch
git clone https://github.com/charlotte-ngs/LBGHS2017.git
# change into the subdirectory with the RStudio project 
cd LBGHS2017/
# create gh-pages branch
git checkout -b gh-pages
# check whether it got created, result should be branches gh-pages and master
git branch
# delete master branch, we do not use it in here
git branch -d master
# check, result should be only gh-pages branch
git branch
# remove all unwanted material from master branch
git rm -rf ex
# add, commit and push to gh-pages
git add .
git commit -m"First commit of gh-pages branch"
git push origin gh-pages
# check status
git status
```
